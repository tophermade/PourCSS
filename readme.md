+# Pour CSS
+Right now just drafting out syntax ideas for a 
+new css preprocessor, supporting all the shit 
+missing from LESS, while trying to stay lightweight 
+looking at you SASS.
+
+## What it is
+Lightweight, portable, compilable language that
+generates CSS.
+
+### Why
+The major preprocessors are older, and come with 
+baggage from earlier needs. Ditch the baggage, 
+in with the new or something, right?
+
+#### Also
+If this manages to make it beyond research, it 
+will ship with cross platform compilation tools 
+GUI and otherwise.
